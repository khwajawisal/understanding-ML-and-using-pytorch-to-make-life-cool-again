# understanding-ML-and-using-pytorch-to-make-life-cool-again
pytorch and basic Ml algorithms implementation both in R as well as Python with ready to use datasets
This repository contrains the asic code for implementation of asic ML and deep learning algorithms in python nad R
This also contains my new initiative of writing neural nets in pytorch.
I will tryt to keep the Repo updated with the latest code
